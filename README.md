This repository will become a Github JSON API to allow API calls between my personal web project and a static data table of self-made DnD loot objects. 
Presently, I am working on editing down the python-based code from a previous project into a readable JSON format with object IDs. 

I am going to update this JSON on my personal laptop via VS code and commit changes to this repository as I progress.
